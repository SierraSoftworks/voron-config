# This file contains the can0 network interface configuration. It mirrors
# the configuration found in the systemd-network file and forces the same
# bitrate and restart-ms values. This is necessary because the systemd-network
# might not be installed/configured on your system.
#
# This file should be placed in /etc/network/interfaces.d/
